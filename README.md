# Weather App - JavaScript Practice

A simple weather app built for **JavaScript practice** using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API and demonstrates DOM manipulation, API calls, and event handling.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is created for **learning and practicing JavaScript fundamentals**:
- DOM manipulation with `createElement`, `appendChild`, etc.
- Fetch API for HTTP requests
- Event listeners and handling user input
- LocalStorage for data persistence
- Template literals and string formatting
- Date manipulation and formatting

## ✨ Features

- Search weather for any city
- Default city (Delhi) loads on startup
- Refresh button to reload current city's weather
- Dynamic weather card creation using JavaScript
- Responsive design
- Weather details: temperature, description, feels like, humidity, wind speed, pressure
- Weather icons from OpenWeatherMap
